## âœ… Module Summary

- Defensive frameworks provide structured ways to understand attacks.  
- Models like **Kill Chain** and **Unified Kill Chain** show intrusion stages.  
- **Pyramid of Pain** emphasizes prioritizing detection of behaviors (TTPs).  
- **Diamond Model** and **MITRE ATT&CK** support attribution and coverage.  
- Hands-on rooms (Summit, Eviction) teach applying theory to practice.  

**How Iâ€™ll apply this:**  
Iâ€™ll use these frameworks to map detections in SIEM/EDR, prioritize behavior-based detection, and follow structured approaches during incident analysis and response.
