# Module 2: Cyber Threat Intelligence

This module builds on defensive frameworks by introducing **threat intelligence** â€” the collection, analysis, and use of information to anticipate, detect, and respond to adversary activity.

## âœ… Module Summary

- CTI adds **context and foresight** to SOC operations.  
- Tools like **YARA, MISP, and OpenCTI** support structured intelligence management.  
- CTI lifecycle ensures repeatable, reliable analysis.  
- Hands-on rooms (Friday Overtime, Trooper) show how to apply CTI in real incidents.  

**How Iâ€™ll apply this:**  
Iâ€™ll use CTI to enrich alerts, improve detection rules, pivot across IoCs, and produce actionable reports. This will help anticipate adversary behavior and guide defensive strategy.
