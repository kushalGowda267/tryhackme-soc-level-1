[TryHackMe Room Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/diamondmodelrmuwwg42)

## Objective
Use the Diamond Model to structure intrusion analysis with four core features.

## Key Concepts
- Adversary ↔ Capability ↔ Infrastructure ↔ Victim  
- Relationships over time and context  
- Supports attribution and richer analysis

## Tools
- MISP, TheHive  
- Graph visualization (Maltego)  
- Evidence analysis (pcap, logs)

## Summary & Application
The Diamond Model teaches relational thinking in investigations. Apply by documenting links between adversary, tools, infrastructure, and affected assets for better attribution.
