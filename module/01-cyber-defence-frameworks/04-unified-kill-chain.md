[TryHackMe Room Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/unifiedkillchain)

## Objective
Learn a modernized model combining multiple attack frameworks for enterprise relevance.

## Key Concepts
- Unified phases merging multiple kill chains  
- Emphasis on supply chain, persistence, detection engineering  
- Mapping telemetry to attack phases

## Tools
- Threat modeling tools  
- SIEM correlation logic  
- EDR telemetry  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## Summary & Application
Unified Kill Chain provides better coverage than older models. Apply by mapping detections to phases and closing telemetry gaps across endpoints, network, and identity.
