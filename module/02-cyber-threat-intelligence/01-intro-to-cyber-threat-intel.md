## Objective
Learn the basics of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), its types, lifecycle, and role in security operations.

## Key Concepts
- CTI types: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, Technical  
- Intelligence lifecycle: Direction → Collection → Processing → Analysis → Dissemination → Feedback  
- Importance of standards (STIX, TAXII)  
- Role of CTI in proactive defense

## Tools
- Threat intel feeds (AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal)  
- Standards: STIX/TAXII  
- CTI platforms (MISP, OpenCTI)

## Summary & Application
CTI provides context beyond raw data. Applying this means enriching incidents with threat intel, mapping TTPs to MITRE, and improving detection rules using intelligence reports.
