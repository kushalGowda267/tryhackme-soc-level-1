[TryHackMe Room Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/cyberkillchainzmt)

## Objective
Understand each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain and how defenders can disrupt attacks.

## Key Concepts
- Stages: Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → C2 → Actions on Objectives  
- Early detection prevents escalation  
- Controls can be mapped to each stage

## Tools
- IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)  
- EDR, email gateways, web proxies  
- Vulnerability scanners  
- SIEM

## Summary & Application
Kill Chain shows where to apply controls and detections. In practice, map detections to each stage (e.g., block suspicious attachments, monitor outbound traffic).
